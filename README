# Rails Contributors Tools

A small Ruby toolkit for exploring and organising data about Ruby on Rails contributors.

## Overview

These scripts and CSV files work together to:
1. Collect Rails contributor data from [contributors.rubyonrails.org](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org).
2. Extract their GitHub usernames by following commit links.
3. Keep track of which contributors could or couldn’t be matched.
4. Generate a simple webpage (`rails_mobs.html`) that forms “mob programming” groups of contributors.

## File Descriptions

### CSV Files

- **contributors.csv**  
  Original export of contributors with their commit counts and contributor URLs.

- **contributors_with_github.csv**  
  Output CSV containing contributors successfully matched with GitHub usernames.

- **contributors_github_resume.csv**  
  Stores partial progress — the script resumes from where it left off.

- **unavailable.csv**  
  List of contributors whose GitHub usernames couldn’t be found.

---

### Ruby Scripts

- **contributors_github.rb**  
  Reads each contributor’s page, follows their first commit link to GitHub, and extracts their username.  
  Creates or updates `contributors_with_github.csv` and `contributors_github_resume.csv`.

- **createweb.rb**  
  Builds the “Rails Mobs” webpage:
  - Reads from `contributors_with_github.csv`
  - Excludes names found in `unavailable.csv`
  - Randomly assigns 4 contributors per mob group
  - Links each username to their GitHub profile
  - Links each group heading to a [mobti.me](https://mobti.me) mob timer  
  Outputs: `rails_mobs.html`

- **ror.rb**  
  Early prototype for scraping contributor data — mostly redundant now but kept for reference.

---

### Outputs

- **rails_mobs.html**  
  Generated webpage listing randomised mob programming groups with clickable GitHub links and a timer link.

- **output_1.txt**, **output2.txt**, **output3.txt**, **output4.txt**  
  Temporary or debug logs from various scraping or parsing runs.

## Usage

### 1. Extract GitHub usernames
Run the main extraction script:
```bash
ruby contributors_github.rb
